  * Master medical terms on your terms! A combination text/workbook, Exploring Medical Language, 7th Edition provides exercises that make it easy to build an understanding of medical terminology. Organized by body system, medical terms are divided into two categories: 1) Words built from word parts, and 2) Words NOT built from word parts. Fun and engaging exercises help you first learn word parts and then learn how to combine the parts into full medical terms that make sense. The text also comes packaged with paper flashcards. For more practice, you can visit an Evolve website with games, activities, flashcards and practice exams. From well-known educators Danielle LaFleur Brooks, Myrna LaFleur Brooks, and Dale Levinsky, this learning package helps you gain fluency in medical language and communicate clearly in the health care setting.
